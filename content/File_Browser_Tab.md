## Image Directory at Startup

At the top you can define the image directory to use at startup. It
could be the RawTherapee installation directory, the last-visited
directory, the home directory, or a custom directory.

## File Browser / Thumbnail Options

This option defines whether you can see date and time or Exif
information below the images in the file browser.

## Context Menu Options

Adjust the grouping of the right-click context menu in the [File Browser](file_browser) (and
[Filmstrip](the_image_editor_tab#the_filmstrip)).

## Parsed Extensions

Choose which files are recognized as images and displayes in the [File Browser](file_browser). All supported extensions are set by
default. They can be deactivated by unchecking the relevant box. If a
desired extension is missing you can easily add it by using the plus
button.

## Cache Options

These options influence the speed of thumbnail loading and generation.
These options are quite self-explanatory.
