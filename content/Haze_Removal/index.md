## Introduction

Removes atmospheric haze. Usually increases saturation and detail. Might
remove color casts, but might also introduce a blue cast which can be
corrected using other tools.

## Usage

Adjust the strength and depth as needed. You can visualize which areas
are most affected by enabling the depth map - the lighter the color, the
more that area is dehazed.
