It is unlikely you will ever need to use the Raw Black Points tool other
than for diagnostic purposes.

These sliders allow you to add offsets to the raw channel values in case
the values used in the program are incorrect. You would know that they
are incorrect if the colors of your image were severely wrong, for
example you would see dark green instead of black, or the whole image
would have a very strong magenta color cast. Cameras with a
[Bayer filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter) have two green
channels, that is why there are two green sliders which are linked by
default. Sometimes the two green channels are of different sensitivity,
so you can unlink the two green sliders and adjust them individually.
