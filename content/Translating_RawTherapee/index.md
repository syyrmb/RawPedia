Translating RawTherapee

This article explains how you can help translate RawTherapee's
interface.

## Introduction

RawTherapee's graphical user interface contains text in many places. In
order to allow showing this text in various languages, the code contains
only a key, and whenever text is meant to be displayed the code looks
for that key in a plain-text [key--value
pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute–value_pair) translation
file, which corresponds to the language selected by the user (or
auto-detected by RawTherapee, based on system settings). When a key is
found in the chosen translation file, they key's value is used. If not
found, the English value is used as a fallback.

The file which contains the reference key--value pairs is called
[`default`](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/blob/dev/rtdata/languages/default).
It uses American English. All translations are based on this file.
Whenever a key is not found in a translation, the value from this file
is used.

Translation files reside in
[`/rtdata/languages`](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/blob/dev/rtdata/languages/)

Every once in a while we run the `/tools/generateTranslationDiffs`
script which updates each translation file with new keys from the
`default` file. If a new key--value pair is added to `default`, the
script copies this pair into the translation file if it did not exist,
and since the value at that point is in English it prefixes that line
with an exclamation mark - when RawTherapee looks for a translated
string, it ignores lines prefixed with an exclamation mark. When someone
translates that value, they must remove the exclamation mark so that it
stops being ignored.

A shortcoming of the system is that if a key's value in the `default`
file changes and that entry has already been translated, then the
translation becomes outdated and this fact is not marked in any way. For
this reason people maintaining a translation need to keep an eye on
changes to existing values in `default` and update their translation
accordingly. One way of keeping an eye on changes to `default` is by
checking [git commits which affect that
file](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/commits/dev/rtdata/languages/default).

Using the "Exposure compensation" label as an example:

- The key used in the code is `TP_EXPOSURE_EXPCOMP`.
- The `default` file contains the key--value pair:
    
  `TP_EXPOSURE_EXPCOMP;Exposure compensation`
- The `English (US)` file contains the same pair, but prefixed with an
  exclamation mark:
    
  `!TP_EXPOSURE_EXPCOMP;Exposure compensation`
- Translations should contain the key with the value translated and the
  exclamation mark removed, e.g.:
    
  `TP_EXPOSURE_EXPCOMP;Lorem ipsum`

## How To

1.  Check whether there is an existing translation file of the language
    into which you're interested in translating by looking into
    [`/rtdata/languages`](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/tree/dev/rtdata/languages)
    - If one does not exist, download the
      [`English (US)`](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/blob/dev/rtdata/languages/English%20(US))
      file (right-click the "Raw" button and "Save link as"), then
      rename it into your language - let's call it `Inuktitut` for the
      purpose of this article.
    - If there is one, download it (right-click the "Raw" button and
      "Save link as").
2.  Translate new strings.
      
    Open `Inuktitut` in a modern text editor (Windows users: do not use
    "Notepad", get [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) instead).
    All the strings that need translating are on lines that begin with
    an exclamation mark, you will find them at the end of the file if
    you're updating an existing translation. Translate them, and remove
    the exclamation mark prefix from each translated line.

    As an example, you would translate

    `!TP_EXPOSURE_EXPCOMP;Exposure compensation`

    to

    `TP_EXPOSURE_EXPCOMP;Lorem ipsum`
3.  Update existing strings
      
    If your `Inuktitut` file has already been translated a long time
    ago, chances are that some of the translated parts are out of date.
    To update them, open the latest
    [`default`](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/blob/dev/rtdata/languages/default)
    file in a window covering the right half of your screen, open
    `Inuktitut` in a window covering the left half of your screen, then
    go through each already-translated string in `Inuktitut`, compare it
    to the English string in `default`, and update the translation if it
    no longer matches the English string.
4.  When done translating, open a [new issue in
    GitHub](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/issues/new) and
    attach your translation to it. Please do not create patch files of
    translations, just send us the whole translated file. We will then
    run it through the `/tools/generateTranslationDiffs` script which
    will sort the entries, add new keys, and delete ones which are no
    longer used. We will then commit it to the codebase.
5.  When you want to update your translation in the future, you must
    download the latest version of that file from the repository from
    [`/rtdata/languages`](https://github.com/Beep6581/RawTherapee/tree/dev/rtdata/languages)

## Markup

Some lines have elements which should appear in bold or italics, or have
characters which must be written in a special way. This is accomplished
using [markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language). However,
parsing markup is slightly slower than parsing plain text, so
RawTherapee only supports markup on keys which we know to require it.
That means that if you use markup on keys which do not support it, then
those keys will not display correctly. Always stick to the style used in
`default`. If a key in `default` does not use markup then neither should
your translation.

When a key uses markup, certain characters must be written using their
[HTML character entity
reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references)
name:

- Write `<` using `<;`
- Write `>` using `>;`
- Write `&` using `&;`

How to know when markup is needed? Look at `default`. For example:

- `HISTORY_MSG_251;B&;W - Algorithm` uses markup to display the `&`
  character, and so should your translation.
- `PARTIALPASTE_RAWCACORR_CAREDBLUE;CA red & blue` does not use markup
  to display the `&` character, and neither should your translation.
- `FILEBROWSER_EMPTYTRASHHINT;`<b>`Permanently`</b>` delete all files in trash.`
  uses markup to make the word "Permanently" appear in bold when
  displayed in RawTherapee, and so should your translation.
