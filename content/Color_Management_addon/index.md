## Colorimetry concepts

This document aims at several objectives about colorimetry:

1. To summarize the raw file processing pipeline from a colorimetry
point of view and to highlight key points and gaps

2. To explain the main steps principles in order to allow the user to
be able to weight what is at stake.

3. To explain the use of some functions that may look obscure to
newcomers.

Note: This document only deals with RawTherapee 4 and computing with
real numbers, and not RawTherapee 3. More over it does not take into
account possible malfunctioning (bugs) still unsolved !

### Warning

- This document doesn't aim to deal with the whole colorimetry aspects
  that aren't specific to RawTherapee, like for instance:
  - the printing,
  - screens calibration.
- However, it is recommended to calibrate the screens with one of the
  many products in the market: colorimetric probe plud software. The
  created profile is for the monitor only and must never, in any case,
  be used either as input profile or output profile.
- Under Windows, MacOS or Linux, a software like DispalGUI from Argyll,
  combined with a probe of quality, even old (e.g. the DTP94 probe I
  own, and for which it doesn't exist any more \[??\] drivers for
  Windows) give very good results ; the processing time is quite long
  (about an hour).
- RawTherapee automatically detects the system profile, however you can
  enter the screen icc filename in « Preference/ Color Management /
  Monitor Profile »
- The reader shall preferably have minimal knowledges about color
  management : matrix triplet, RGB, XYZ, Lab, color space, primaries and
  colorimetric profile... wise readers can read the B. Lindbloom's
  website [1](http://www.brucelindbloom.com)
- The histogram display as well as the browser can be configured: by
  default, the displayed values take into account the "Output profile".
  You can change this behaviour going into "Preferences" and checking
  "Use working profile for main histogram and navigator"
- Of course, this document is far to be exhaustive, the subject is
  complex.

### Initial raw processing before RGB conversion

#### Read the raw file and use its data

- Le first step that is essentially carried out on a Dcraw basis (thanks
  to D.Coffin) consists in reading all types of raw files, with their
  proprietary coding: data depth, 12 or 14 bits, sensor saturation,
  white balance, ... and of course rggb or rgbg data;
- the default white balance is the one chosen by the user on his/her
  camera for the shooting!
- the interpolation (AMaZE, AHD, DCB...) takes place after by rgb data
  modifying (the image can be visually evaluated on a screen): the
  interpolation shouldn't modify the colorimetry (or a very few) and
  that is the case for all the existing interpolations in RawTherapee
  (deltaE94 due to interpolation is approximatively 1, so negligible),
  in the other hand, at the limits (upper highlights ...) artefacts may
  appear for some of them.
- in order to give them a more realistic look, these rgb data are
  modified by either a color matrix (from Adobe), or a DCP profile (from
  Adobe or RawTherapee), or an ICC input profile, we will below come
  back about these ICC profiles, their elaboration and use;
- rgb values are without any color space - this point is essential (the
  choice sRGB or AdobeRGB for example suggested by the camera is for JPG
  files sonly)
- the color management is processed: a) partially with LCMS2, that made
  great improvements, and can now work using floating point avoiding
  colors cliping; b) directly by computing (conversion of XYZ, Lab, RGB,
  gamma, etc.)

#### ICC input profiles : elaboration, use, gaps

- these profiles apply either like external profiles after RGB
  conversion (as does Capture NX2) to the rgb data, so theoretically
  without [rendering
  intent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_management#Rendering_intent)
  (relative, absolute, perceptual, saturation). They modify Lab values
  but not rgb ones - histograms remain the same, or like internal
  profiles as does RawTherapee (theoretically without [rendering
  intent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_management#Rendering_intent));
- they try to reduce the gap between their original values (the sensor
  ones) and a target value, theoretically perfect;
- they are theoretically matching: a given illuminant (D50, C,
  shadow,...), test pattern shooting conditions, lens shooting...
- nevertheless, we can without any problem, use them as long as we stay
  approximatively in the same environment, e.g. flash instead of
  daylight, D55 instead of de D50...

1.  shoot a test pattern in ideal conditions matching the planned use
    (outside, studio, ...);
2.  the wider the test pattern gamut is, the better the result is, e.g.
    the ColorChecker24 is close to sRGB, even if it gives good results
    in usual cases, how could it efficiently evaluate real colors that
    are out sRGB range (flowers, artificial colors ...)?
3.  the higher is the test pattern cells number, better the result is
    (better profile guiding)
4.  The 468 colors test pattern, designed with a colleague "Rouli", is
    over WideGamut for some colors, and owns low luminance values.
5.  for your information, about my D200, deltaE94 results gotten from my
    468 colors test pattern shoot (NEF) on which I apply the input
    profile or matrix: a) original color matrix (Dcraw) – (or results
    obtained with Camera Raw 6.6 and DCP) profile): average=4.37,
    standard deviation=1.82, maximum=13.75 ; b) ICC profile, stored in
    the "Iccprofile" folder, elaborated from the ColorChecker24 close to
    sRGB: average==3.66, standard deviation=2.08, maximum=11.28; c) ICC
    profile, elaborated by myself from the 468 colors test pattern with
    very wide gamut, close to WideGamutRGB: average==2.05, standard
    deviation=1.44, maximum=8.8; d) of course, most of the time, the
    profile made with a ColorChecker24 (ICC or DCP) wil be enough!
6.  shoot the test pattern at about 12 o'clock in direct sunlight (a),
    or in cloudy weather (b), or in the shadow (c), or with tungsten
    light (d), or with a Solux studio light (e) that has a spectre very
    close to the daylight, or (f) another light that match your needs:
    1.  set the camera in manual mode (exposure...);
    2.  set the white balance on a) 5000K (or similar to "sunlight"); b)
        6000K; c) 8000K; d) tungsten 2850K; e) Sun 4700K; f)... ;
    3.  ensure there is no reflect;
    4.  take several photos each 1/3 EV;
    5.  ensure the most perfect possible exposure equality between the
        test pattern centre and four sides.
7.  save the raw files in a folder called RawTherapee
8.  open the raw with the "neutral" pp3 profile et choose "Prophoto" as
    "working profile", in "Input Profile", choose "No profile"
9.  evaluate the exposure from one of the test pattern grey cell which
    luminance lie between L=40 et L=60 and study the exposure difference
    between the test pattern dark sides; choose the shoot with the best
    compromise; do the shoot again if necessary.
10. set the exposure with "raw white-black point" - "white point: linear
    corr.factor" ensuring that "White point HL preserving corr(EV)" is
    set to zero, in such a manner that the L value of the grey reference
    cell being the closest possible of the reference.
11. tweak the white balance with SpotWB, choosing a grey cell (20 \< L
    \< 80) of which the "a" and "b" values are the closest to zero (for
    this operation the "a" and "b" values must be inferior to 0,5;
    otherwise, if the cell has "a" and "b" values close to 1, tweak with
    the "temperature" and "hue" sliders (see below the notes about white
    balance) in such a manner to arrive to the reference cell Lab
    values.
12. then click on "Save reference image for profiling"
13. use your "profiler" which will use, according to the maker, either
    the spectral values or the Lab or XYZ values: generate a
    reproduction type profile for the illuminant matching the shooting
    (D50, D65, Solux, etc.).
14. of course, some « profilers » (Profilemaker5, etc.) allows to
    elaborate profiles that are not « reproduction » profiles that
    minimise the deltaE94, but profiles that will give a specific
    rendering (portrait, landscape, etc.) by acting on the contrast
    curve and on the differentiated chromaticity between pastel and
    saturated tones. These profiles are working, but in my point of
    view, are out of RawTherapee's mind by introducing from the
    processes beginning, hue and contrasts gaps that can't be corrected
    any more by the various algorithms. Nevertheless, this choice is
    possible.

#### White balance

##### White balance gaps

- The white balance is really operational only with the use of "SpotWB"
  on a perfect grey ("a" and "b" Lab values set to zero), but as it is
  quasi impossible to put a grey chart on each shot (otherwise to do it
  like Alfred Hitchcock), if you want to tweak the camera white balance,
  you have generally to use the "Temperature" and "Tint" sliders;
- But the sliders have a range from 1500K to 25000K, and the used
  computing basis matching the D illuminant (Daylight) is not valid
  under 4000K (computing is only an extrapolation)
- Moreover, data become false if the illuminant is different from the
  day light (D), for example the illuminant "Blackbody" or "Fluorescent"
- Then, show caution, great caution, when you are out of the D
  illuminant (daylight) and for temperatures under 4000K

##### Principles

Shooting: When shooting, two basis options are available to the user: a)
To work in raw mode, in this case, mistakes are authorized and a
retouches are possible with a raw processing software, for example
RawTherapee; b) to work in JPEG mode, in this case, if the white balance
choice on the camera is different that the real light conditions, the
retouch is more difficult. We will give more importance to the raw mode
study.

However a camera owns (essential for JPEG, useful for raw) several white
balance settings. Of course theses functionalities vary from a model and
maker to one another, but we often find:

- An "auto" mode: the camera electronic decide which value is right from
  home-made algorithms. This mode generally works pretty well, except
  when there is strong dominant colors.
- A "manual" mode where the user, for some brands, enters a temperature
  value, e.g. 7000K. This choice is made by a confirmed user, on his/her
  experience basis.
- A "pre-set" mode where the user can choose amongst several situations
  predetermined in "the factory": "sun", "shadow", "cloudy", « flash »,
  « incandescent », « fluorescent »,...
- Note: each brand and model has its own specificities, e.g. for the
  fluorescent mode: a) Canon equips its cameras with only one mode;
  b)Fuji gives 3; c) Pentax gives 3 ;d) Nikon gives up to 7 (D3S,
  D300,...); e) etc.
- Note also: the "flash" value differs from one brand to another one,
  e.g. for: a) Nikon D300, the flash illuminant matches roughly
  6400K; b) Leica R9, the flash illuminant matches roughly 5500K; c)
  Sony A900, the flash illuminant matches roughly "shade", that means
  about 7000K...
- of course in most of the cases, the choice of pre-set is pretty
  obvious, but in some other cases the user won't know what to chose...
  Indeed, during an exhibition, a visit to the museum, etc. what is the
  lighting in use ?
- All these settings act on the channels multipliers;
- At the end, during a raw processing, this choice will be displayed in
  RawTherapee as "Camera".

##### Raw processing

RawTherapee allows 5 possibilities:

- « Camera » : the software uses - when existing - the shooting EXIF
  data
- « Auto » : the software values the white balance at the "average" data
  on a theoretical neutral grey basis;
- « pre-set settings »: like Shade, Daylight, Fluorescent, etc.
- « Custom »: the user can choose Temperature and Tint (see the section
  [White balance gaps](#white_balance_gaps))
- « Spot WB »: the user choose a neutral-grey area as a reference. This
  almost means a neutral-grey chart must be present when shooting.

##### Colored object – illuminant – observer

Simplifying, colorimetry can be synthesised in three kinds of data:

- Colored object: characterized by its pigments (red, blue,...) whatever
  the lighting source is. It can be evaluated with a spectrometer, that
  will give an unique representation of it
- Illuminant or Lighting source: this data characterize the nature of
  the illumination source (sun at noon, shade, flash, tungsten,
  fluorescent...). It is valued by two data: its spectral power
  distribution and its correlated temperature; caution! two lighting
  sources that have the same temperature are not identical because their
  spectral data are different.
- Observer: Do the following test, observe the color of a painted wall,
  then the one of the sample that was used to make the choice, you will
  notice that the color feeling is different. CIE (Commission
  Internationale de l’Éclairage) defined two "observers", 2° and 10°,
  characterized by the angle under which the color is observed.

To compute the values observed from a colored object, under the X
illuminant, it is necessary to take into account in the computing the
object, illuminant and observer spectral data. These values XYZ are
specific to the illuminant temperature (e.g. 6500K); at a software
level, (Photoshop, RawTherapee...) the standard is D50. So, it is
imperative to proceed to a chromatic adaptation from the XYZ values
(illuminant) to the XYZ (D50). For that, several methods exist from the
less to the most efficient: Von Kries, Bradford, CIECAM02.

##### The Daylight illuminant

This illuminant has been object of many studies by Judd, MacAdam and
Wyszecki, from several hundreds of examples. In short, the "D"
illuminant is the sum of three parts: S(lamda)=S0(lamda) +
M1\*S1(lamda)+M2\*S2(lamda)

1.  one "fix" part, So that is the average of all the tested examples;
2.  one first "variable" part, S1 that matches the "blue/yellow"
    variations due to the presence or not of clouds or to the position
    and the intensity of the direct sun;
3.  one second "variable" part, S2 that matches the "pink/green"
    variations due to the presence of humidity in the form of vapour or
    fog ...;
4.  in practical terms, that can be written in a "simple" formula that
    determines two values x_D and y_D on a temperature and an illuminant
    basis

- x_D=0.244063 + 0.0991\*103/T+2.9678\*106/T2 -4.6070\*109/T3 for 4000K
  \< T \< 7000K
- x_D=0.237040 + 0.24748\*103/T + 1.9018\*106/T2 -2.0064\*109/T3 for
  7000K \< T \< 25000K
- y_D = -3.0\*x_D2 + 2.87\*x_D-0.275
- these formulas are used to calculate the parameters M1(x_D,y_D) and
  M2(x_D,y_D) of S(lamda)=S0(lamda) + M1\*S1(lamda)+M2\*S2(lamda) – it
  was not the case so far in RawTherapee. Previously, in RawTherapee,
  the xD and yD values were directly used to calculate the channels
  multipliers, now, these values are used to determine the illuminant
  spectral values at the T temperature. It is only later on that second
  values are calculated that allow to determine the multipliers.

Two things can be immediately noticed:

- it does not exist any "Daylight" reference under 4000K, the previous
  formula used in RawTherapee (from 1200K to 4000K) has been "invented"
  for Ufraw;
- nothing prevents to modify RawTherapee to switch the maximum value
  from 12000K to 25000K (done since 2013)

##### "Blackbody" illuminant and "A: tungsten"

The A illuminant from CIE is used to represent the typical light of a
domestic bulb tungsten filament. Its relative spectral power
distribution is the one of a Planck radiator at an approximative
temperature of 2856K. The A illuminant from CIE can be used in any
colorimetry application involving the use of an incandescent light,
unless there is specific reasons to use another illuminant.

The "Blackbody" illuminant can be caculated with the Planck formula that
is the generalisation of the illuminant on a T basis:

- S(lamda)= c1 \* pow(wavelength, -5.0)) / (exp(c2 / (wavelength \*
  blackbody_Temp)) – 1.0);

where the 2 values c1 and c2 match to: a) c1=2\*Pi\*h\*c2 h=Planck
constant c=light velocity ; b) c2=h\*c/k k=Boltzmann constant

This illuminant correctly joins up at roughly 4000K with the " Daylight"
illuminant with minimal gaps. I accordingly chose for RawTherapee to use
the "Blackbody" illuminant under 4000K and up to 1500K (it seems that
"ACR" did the same choice).

##### The Fluorescent illuminants

Standardisation has foreseen 12 illuminants of his type, matching the
lighting tubes sold in the shops:

- F1 : Fluorescent daylight – 6430K
- F2 : White fluorescent cold – 4230K
- F3 : White fluorescent – 3450K
- F4 : White fluorescent warm – 2940K
- F5 : Fluorescent daylight – 6350K
- F6 : White luminous fluorescent – 4150K
- F7 : D65 simulator – 6500K
- F8 : D50 simulator – 5000K
- F9 : White cold deluxe – 4150K
- F10 : Philips T85 – 5000K
- F11 : Philips T84 – 4000K
- F12 : Philips T83 – 3000K

These illuminants (see [white balance
gaps](#White_balance_gaps.md)) have a very different spectral
power distribution between them and between the "daylight" and
"blackbody" illuminants. So it is not advised to replace - when a
lighting is fluorescent - the illuminant in question (e.g. F11 4000K) by
an equivalent "Daylight 4000K".

<figure>
<img src="/images/Comp4000.jpg" title="Comp4000.jpg" />
<figcaption>Comp4000.jpg</figcaption>
</figure>

Actually, the white balance calculates on the spectral data basis, two
coefficients xD, yD that modify the channels multipliers: this
calculation acts as an averaged integral calculus. Indeed, the "average"
white balance will be exact, but the spectral data peaks or gaps,
compared with a theoretical ideal (blackbody or daylight) will locally
bring, for some colors, hue gaps more or less important.

It exists a concept called "CRI = Color Rendering Index" that translates
the lighting source quality. This "CRI" is a number equal to 100 for a
perfect source. We consider that values over 90 give good results. e.g.:

- Fluo F4 "warm white": CRI=51
- Clear Mercury Vapor: CRI=17
- several LED with "CRI" between 50 and 96
- Solux 4700: CRI=92
- etc.

This concept is embedded (not used yet) in RawTherapee with the
following choices:

- 20 reference colors of which, 8 "standard" from the Colorchecker24, 4
  skin hues, 4 greys (white-black), 3 blues
- use of CIECAM02 for the chromatic adaptation
- use of CIE Lab for deltaE calculation

To remedy it (partially) it is enough to create an [input
profile](#ICC_input_profiles_:_elaboration,_use,_gaps.md) with
the desired lighting source and the matching spectral data.

##### Other illuminants

Other illuminants exist, stemmed from the A illuminant and close to
"Daylight"

- B and C that I did not embedded in RawTherapee, but it is possible to
  do it
- an illuminant with equal energy: "E"
- The studio bulbs illuminants (movies, stage lighting, museums, photo
  studio, etc.) that are named HMI, GTI, Solux 4700K , JudgeIII,
  Solix4100K, Solux3500K, etc., they are embedded in RawTherapee.
- The LED illuminant, these lamps often have large gaps in the blues.
  Some of them own very satisfactory features
- "Proprietary" flashes illuminants (Canon , Nikon, Pentax...) and
  studio flashes illuminants, they are generally very close to daylight,
  but each one at different temperatures. I did several grouping at
  5500K, 6000K et 6500K, about studio flashes, it should be useful to
  have their features: a) theoretically it should be useful to have the
  spectral data for each flash (I don't have them), moreover, these data
  vary depending on the flash power ...; b) so, I preferred to use the
  equivalent "daylight".

As we can see, the situation is not simple and pose many problems to the
raw processing software, of which RawTherapee.

##### Algorithm

I use the basic algorithm "Daylight": a) calculation of the x_D and y_D
values that are given as parameters to M1 and M2 (S(lamda) = S0(lamda) +
M1\*S1(lamda) +M2\*S2(lamda) from which we differentiate Xi,Yi,Zi by
matrix calculation \[XiYiZi\]=\[observ2°xyz\]\[S(lambda)\], then we
calculate the channels modifiers modifications by a simple matrix
calculation \[mulrgb\]=\[sRGBd65_xyz\]\*\[XiYiZi\] (lebarhon: no b)!)

- I used works of John Walker (public domain), and B.Lindbloom -
  increasing the accuracy and the spectral range - mostly the
  "Spectrum_to_xyz" function, as known as "CIE_color_match" that
  converts spectral data (350 – 830nm) of a color or an illuminant into
  xBar, yBar, zBar values (via the Observer 2° data). We get the output
  values x and y.

About the blackbody, I use the Planck formula: the seem between the two
formulas is very good with a very slight gap of the xD and yD values at
4000K (that we can make out with the histogram between 3995K and
40005K): a) daylight 4000K: xD=0.382 yD=0.383 (for your information for
4500K : xD=0.362 yD=0.370, for 7000K xD=0.30 yD=0.32, for 25000K xD=0.25
yD=0.25); b) blackbody 4000K: xD=0.381 yD=0.377;

For the other illuminants, the works I previously did on the calibration
(test pattern 468 colors) led me to search for (and find out) the
illuminants spectral data I selected (tungsten, fluorescents, HMI, GTI,
Solux, etc.)

=== rgb ==\> RGB conversion - Working space "Working Profile" === This
"conversion" converts rgb data (without color space) into the working
space chosen by the user.

These working spaces are 11 of them (which sounds more than enough, or
even too much...): sRGB, AdobeRGB, Prophoto, Widegamut, BruceRGB,
BetaRGB, BestRGB, Rec2020, ACESp0, ACESp1, JDCmax amongst these 11
profiles, 8 have a wide gamut: BetaRGB (origin B.Lindbloom), BestRGB,
Rec2020, WideGamut and Prophoto, ACESp1, ACESp0, JDCmax.

Note that other software made other choices:

- Adobe with ACR suggests 4 choices (AdobeRGB, ColorMatch, Prophoto and
  SRGB)
- Adobe with Lightroom: no choice, but a modified Prophoto space with a
  sRGB gamma (Melissa)
- DxO: no choice, but a Adobe space
- NX2: choice in the available output spaces

Which one to choose ? Wide ranging debate where small spaces supporters
conflict with wide spaces ones... between data lost and false or
imaginary data. Indeed, the widest space (Prophoto) houses, by
construction, invisible or even imaginary colors. Moreover, in the blues
area, it may under some circumstances, generate artefacts.

A good color space would have a shape taking into account the gamut that
minimize the waste of space... which means the space should be chosen
depending on each image, a too wide space could be generating
unsaturated colors in extremes cases (in the working profile, but which
will be reproduced during the output conversion ...). Nevertheless,
theoretically, the color management must make this choice tranparent.

My answer is pragmatic, choose the space that match the best! but, on
what basis ?

- Do you make essentially prints with a printer that use a CMYK driver?
  In this case it is not really useful to choose a wide gamut profile.

<figure>
<img src="/images/GAMUTS.jpg"
title="representation of 4 profiles or spaces gamut" />
<figcaption>representation of 4 profiles or spaces gamut</figcaption>
</figure>

- Do you make prints with a high quality ink-jet printer? In this case,
  it is better to choose Prophoto (this kind of printers have a gamut,
  that for some colors, is wider than WidegamutRGB), as working profile,
  but also as output profile, and of course to choose the right printer
  profile... on this graphic, we can see the gamut of a) 3 usual color
  spaces (sRGB in blue, AdobeRGB in pink, WideGamut in yellow), b) the
  ICC profile ffor my D200 in grey, c) the Epson printer profile and its
  "3800MOABKOKOPELI_2431_V4" wide gamut paper.

<!-- -->

- Do you have a very high quality monitor which has a gamut close to
  AdobeRGB or WideGamutRGB, in this case take a wide gamut profile.

A pretty simple way to evaluate the minimum profile is to use the
statistics given by "vibrance" in debug mode (with verbose=true). In the
RawTherapee.exe window you will see a message:

- Gamut : G1negat=x iter - G165535= y iter - G2negat= z iter - G265535=
  w iter
- if a value (x or y) over 0 appears for one of the two G1, that means
  the initial image (with the controls made before: contrast,
  exposure,...) exceed the chosen space gamut in the working profile.
- if a value (z or w) over 0 appears for one of the two G2, that means
  the saturation set by "vibrance" exceeded the gamut.
- It is up to you to choose if you want to keep these values (see above)
  or to put them into the gamut (vibrance do it for you, as well as
  "avoid color cliping" + "enable saturation limiter"), but you 'lose'
  colors!
- the conversion rgb==\>RGB allows when working in "float" to preserve
  the essential negatives and over 65535 values.

### Work in the color space chosen by the user (working space "Working Profile")

RawTherapee made the good choice to work in Lab mode (or its flavours
Luv or Lch) or in CIECAM02 mode and with real numbers. This allows to
preserve the best colors and gamut.

Functions available in "Exposure" does not modify the hue, except
"Saturation" that make it by dysfunction of the Lab mode (see about that
the [Munsell correction](#the_"munsell"_correction) section

Same thing for "Lab adjustments", for the "Saturation" slider, along
with the "a" and "b" curves and all the curves that control the
chromaticity.

"Channel Mixer" and "HSV equalizer" modify strongly the colorimetry, to
be used with all the knowledge of the consequences on the colorimetry.
The functions: contrast, brigthness, tone curve,..may quite strongly
modify the gamut (see above the control with the statistics given by
"Vibrance")

### What happens when we are in a "Working Profile" or when we change of "Working Profile" or the settings?

When we are in a narrow profile like sRGB, it may seem obvious that the
colors will be limited to this profile limits! So, if an initial color
(the sensor one, slightly modified by interpolation) is inside sRGB,
what happens when we tweak sliders and curves?:

- in RGB mode (Exposure), if saturation or lightness or contrast is/are
  modified, we work in rgb mode or its linear derived "hsv". This means
  that the resulting effects will depend on the working space ((sRGB,
  AdobeRGB, Prophoto), the results will be different when we move from
  "sRGB" to "Prophoto", even if we stay inside the gamut limits.
- in Lab mode, if lightness, chromaticity, contrast or curves are
  modified, we modify directly the L, a, b, (or C,h) values. This means
  that if we stay inside the gamut limits, the image will be the same
  (within the limits of the color management)

When exceeding the gamut - that is, the original image - either acting
the sliders or the curves, what happens?

- let's take an example, an original color is L=27 a=2 b=-75; this color
  is in the Prophoto space and is worth R=42 G=52 B=158, and in sRGB
  R=-85 G=69 B=184 (negative R means out of gamut). If we change the
  working profile, it is obvious this color can't be restored; the XYZ
  conversion will give L=32 a=21 b=-67 and R=0 G=69 B=184. The color
  will have a different aspect because it is completely impossible to
  reproduce it in a smaller color space.
- second example, a color inside sRGB : L=40 a=42 b=-44, that is in RGB
  (sRGB) R=133 G=66 B=166, and in RGB(Prophoto) R=102 G=64 B=140: a) if
  we apply saturation (+30) in exposure, the values become - Prophoto -
  L=36 a=49 b=-49 and sRGB L=38 a=47 b=-47, because we act on the RGB
  values; b) if we apply chromaticity in Lab adjustments; Lab values
  become L=40 a=55 b=-58 as well in sRGB than Prophoto, because we stay
  inside the sRGB gamut; c) if we choose a color, close enough to the
  sRGB gamut limits, but inside the gamut: L=40 a=63 b=37 and we apply
  chromaticity +30, Lab values become - Prophoto L=40 a=81 b=49 - we can
  notice that the hue is preserved (arctg(b,a)), and in sRGB L=44 a=69
  b=50 – the hue isn't preserved.

### What does "Avoid color shift"?

If we apply to c) above, "Avoid color shift", the system will try to
preserve the hue, by applying a relative colorimetry Lab values become
L=40 a=65 b=38 (which leads to the RGB channel G=0).

"Avoid color shift" realises two things:

- try to put in the working profile gamut data out of this gamut, giving
  priority to a relative colorimetry. RGB negatives values are detected
  and the chromaticity (and luminance as well) are modified to reach the
  value 0.
- apply a "Munsell" correction.

### The "Munsell" correction

Goal: to give the user possibility to automatically correct the colors
that are sometimes false in Lab mode when modifying the saturation,
mostly in the blues-crimsons, reds-yellows and the greens (Munsell type
correction)

This goal requires the creation of 160 look-up tables with
floating-point precision (LUTf):

- These LUTf give to each color (in Munsell sense), each luminance, hue
  values on a chromaticity basis: 2, 3 or 4 points are set for
  chromaticities \[0..180\] from 5, 45, 85, 125 or even 139 when
  possible. Intermediate values are linearly interpolated. These LUT
  cause a minimal memory occupation: each one has between 45 and 140
  entries, that means about 16000 entries at the total...
- The LUTf are realised for four critical areas, where the drift
  compared with the Lab mode is important (blue-crimson, red-yellow,
  green, red-crimson), for the other areas the gaps are low, in any
  cases very much under the matrix and ICC profiles possibilities.
- These LUTf have the C illuminant as basis (slightly different of D50
  or D65), but due to the fact that we work on a gap basis and not on
  absolute values, the calculation error is very low (less than 1% of
  the correction, in any cases very much under the matrix and ICC
  profiles possibilities).
- Theses corrections are quick, nevertheless they are increasing the
  "vibrance" or "Lab adjustments" processing time of about 10%.
- If "verbose" option is enabled, we can see appear for each correction
  type, the concerned number of pixels and a rough idea of the
  correction size (in radians). For correction values in radians, the
  color gap in deltaE94 is the following:

1.  correction=0.4 rad deltaE94=12 for blue-crimson
2.  correction=0.2 rad deltaE94=8 for red-yellow
3.  correction=0,1 rad deltaE94=3,7 for green
4.  correction=0.05 rad deltaE94=2 for red-crimson
5.  the maximum common values of the drift can reach about from 0.05
    radian to 0.15 radian for average modifications of saturation,
    values from 0.2 to 0.25 radian are not exceptionnal.
6.  for information, a deltaE94 less than 1 is negligible, it is
    noticeable around 2 or 3 and very important at 8 or 11.

### Output space "Output Profile"

#### Space choice

The first thing to examine is: what are the output profiles that are
installed on your computer? This depends of: a) the operating system (on
the face of it, Linux does not install any profile); b) the other
graphical software that are installed (Capture NX2, PhotoShop CS, DxO,
etc.), each one install proprietary profiles, for example NX2 installs
some NKsRGB.icm NkAdobe.icm, etc. that are copyrighted...; c) profiles
that you can have downloaded on the web, for example on the Adobe or
B.Lindbloom websites.

On principle I would recommend to check the installation or to install
the output profiles matching the working profiles - that are \*.icm or
\*.icc files physically present on your computer and that have nothing
to do with the calculation matrix of "iccmatrices.h". If these files are
missing, TIFF or JPEG output cannot be done towards these profiles, but
will be by default (if the RT_sRGB.icm file is present) done towards the
SRGB output space.

These profiles have the following names (we can find others that have
the same features or close features), they are generally copyrighted and
consequently cannot be shipped with an Open Source software without
authorization. They are available on the Web: ProPhoto.icm; SRB Color
Space profile.icm ; AdobeRGB1998.icc; BestRGB.icm ; BetaRGB.icc;
Bruce.icm; WideGamutRGB.icc. Of course you can install some others like
CIE.icc ; Colormatch.icc; etc.

They must be installed in the RawTherapee "Iccprofiles/output" folder or
in \windows\system32\spool\drivers\color for Windows and
/usr/share/color/icc for the other systems.

When you choose an output profile, e.g. AdobeRGB1998 and the working
profile Prophoto, LCMS2 will convert with a [Colorimetric
intent](Preferences#Rendering_Intent.md) (chosen by default in
the RawTherapee options: relative, perceptual, ...) the RGB data from
the working space to the output space.

<figure>
<img src="/images/GamutL50.jpg" title="Gamut for a luminance L=50" />
<figcaption>Gamut for a luminance L=50</figcaption>
</figure>

<File:GamutL05.jpg%7CGamut> for a luminance L=5
<File:GamutL25.jpg%7CGamut> for a luminance L=25
<File:GamutL75.jpg%7CGamut> for a luminance L=75
<File:GamutL95.jpg%7CGamut> for a luminance L=95

Of courses, remarks about the choice of the output color space are
similar to the ones about the working space (print, screen,...).

It you want to print with a high quality ink-jet printer (remind:
RawTherapee has no print module so far), you have to use a third party
software (Photoshop...), in this case I strongly recommend an output
profile of Prophoto or WideGamut type.

Take care however, JPG outputs, therefore 8 bits, are almost
incompatible - important risk of posterization - with wide gamut spaces
(Prophoto, WideGamut...).

#### Shipped files

Because of the copyrights, I shipped specific files with more detailed
LUT that should bring less posterization in the shadows. These files are
a by-product of [Output Gamma](#output_gamma) (see below)

- RT_sRGB.icm: similar (primary) to sRGB.icm standard with internal
  gamma close to sRGB: g=2.40 slope=12.92
- RT_sRGB_gBT709.icm: similar (primary) to sRGB.icm standard with
  internal gamma BT709: g=2.22 slope=4.5
- RT_sRGB_g10.icm: similar (primary) to sRGB.icm standard with internal
  gamma linear: g=1.0 slope=0
- RT_Middle_gsRGB.icc: similar (primary) to AdobeRGB1998.icc standard
  with internal gamma close to sRGB: g=2.40 slope=12.92
- RT_Large_gsRGB.icc: similar (primary) to ProPhoto.icm standard with
  internal gamma close to sRGB: g=2.40 slope=12.92 (close to "Melissa"
  used by Lightroom)
- RT_Large_gBT709.icc: similar (primary) to ProPhoto.icm standard with
  internal gamma BT709: g=2.22 slope=4.5
- RT_Large_g10.icc: similar (primary) to ProPhoto.icm standard with
  internal gamma linear: g=1.0 slope=0
- Rec2020.icm: new primaries - large gamut - with internal gamma BT709:
  g=2.22 slope=4.5

#### RawTherapee gaps

The user can easily note that the output is slightly different from
preview. This is not an output default but is due to the curves
elaboration that badly take TRC notion into account (ICC profiles
embedding to modify from the interior the tone rendering).

It is one of the reasons that led me to give possibility of "adjustable"
outputs:

1.  either by choosing an output profile with another gamma;
2.  either with an adjustable gamma (gamma and slope);
3.  either possibly to realise a linear output and adjust it in
    Photoshop...
4.  (see further the histograms sketches)

#### Output Gamma

From my point of view, Output Gamma is one of the key points of a
successful TIFF or JPEG output, for several reasons: since the adding of
icc/icm profiles above - that are directly derived and elaborate by
Output gamma - this option shows a less important interest because the
use of these "new" pseudo-profiles Prophoto and SRGB brings similar
advantages to Output gamma when selecting the pseudo sRGB and Prophoto !
(see above). This option allows to partially compensate the RawTherapee
gap (difference between output/preview)

The ideal would have been to put Output gamma in first process, before
the Exposure, Highlights reconstructions, Shadows/highlights, etc. tabs;
but, and it is what I thing is a RawTherapee gap, this modification
turned out to be impossible without bringing important artefacts: the
different RawTherapee pipelines are overlapping and colorimetry in the
processing initial part, looks more like do it yourself than
professional processing...

I accordingly chose to implant this process in final stage, what is not
totally incongruous (even if I think it would be better in initial
stage) Output Gamma is going to allow:

- an image evaluation for software without color management
- an image modification if youy print in CMYK (with of course a third
  party software).

\[Lebarhon: this section is indeed not clear, the writer says firstly
"Output gamma is a key point for several reasons", and then "this option
shows a less important interest" and where are the several reasons ?\]

#### Some thoughts

The gamma acts in a pretty similar way of a combination between
"Exposure curves" + "black point" + "tone curves" present in
RawTherapee, but modify in a more radically way the contrast, the
histogram repartition, mostly between shades and highlights, by
modifying at the same time (what previous functions can't do), the TRC
curves of the file headers similar to an input ICC profile. A friend of
mine, photographer told me recently: "At the beginning, I thought we
could simulate gamma with contrasts and tonal curves... but the result
is different".

Why indeed has Adobe, with Lightroom, designed "Melissa" that is a
Prophoto color space with a sRGB gamma, i.e. a linear part until r=12.92
and then a gamma of 2,4?

Why has D.Coffin embedded in Dcraw for a long time ago, a linear gamma
and a varying gamma as well?

Theoretically, if the color management is perfect, whatever the output
gamma is (standard, varying...) the image should be identical, because
the color management use Lab (or XYZ) data and what we call PCS (Profil
Connexion Space in D50); in practice, the image seems identical, but is
we watch in the shades, we can see there are gaps, admittedly pretty low
but enough for RawTherapee users could have said: the output image is
different from "preview".

In the other hand, for software that does not manage colors like many
web browsers (Chrome,...) the output image will depend on gamma; it is
then important RawTherapee allow to view what the output file will be
(softproofing). Today, several factors must be taken into account:

- working space ("working profile") conversion towards output space
  (Output profile): it may seem obvious that if the image has colors out
  of the gamut for one or two of the both spaces, if the spaces range is
  different, then the image rendering will be different;
- color management existing or not: in the case of RawTherapee or of an
  editor that manage colors, the gaps (with identical output spaces)
  will be low but nevertheless significant; in the case of software that
  do not manage colors, gamma impact will be very important.
- possibility to configure in the softproofing, the intent and the black
  point.
- Later on, it must be quite easy possible to simulate a print by
  converting the output towards the printer profile; note that in this
  case, a view of the printable colors should be an important plus.

When RawTherapee will have a function similar to Photoshop CS one "proof
format- proof colors", the viewing issue of Output gamma will be solved!
this function allows the "soft proofing", e.g. to simulate the look a
file is going to have in a website or on a CMYK printer.

#### Various Output Gamma

In the drop down list you have 7 pre-defined gamma:

- BT709: slope=4.5 gamma=2.2
- sRGB: slope=12.92 gamma=2.4
- linear: gamma=1.0
- standard:slope=0 gamma=1.8
- standard: slope=0 gamma=2.2
- High: slope=3.35 gamma=1.3
- Low: slope=6.9 gamma=2.6

BT709 "is better to process shades (they will be less grey) than sRGB
and all the more so, 2.2 or 1.8

"Low" will increase the contrast of the quite poor images, and allow a
better post processing for over exposed images

"High" at the opposite will decrease the contrast...

Linear: allows a process in Photoshop of very high dynamic images by
adjusting RGB curves in Photoshop (difficult exercice...)

Moreover, you have possibility to use "free gamma" that allows to
connect any slope and gamma values to a given output profile, so, you
can if desired go out of the new outputs connected to the new added
profiles icc/icm:

- sRGB with standard gamma 1.8
- WideGamut with gamma BT709
- sRGB with gamma: 2.2 and slope 6.5

As examples here is with the same NEF file various histograms with
various gamma and as a reference the RawTherapee histogram (preview)
with the same settings (working spacece Prophoto, profile "neutral",
output profile = Prophoto and its varying gamma).

![Preview Prophoto](RT_prev_Prophoto.jpg "Preview Prophoto")
![<File:GammaS.jpg>](GammaS.jpg "File:GammaS.jpg")

The more the histogram is shifted to the left the more the image appears
dark...

Moreover, it is not because the histograms are strictly identical that
the images rendering will be identical. Indeed, the "TRC" notion take
place as well for the preview as for the output file. This "TRC" acts on
the file headers (ICC profile) and modify the tone data. If the "TRC"
value of the output file is known for certain, because it is determined
by the output file features (Prophoto.icm, RT_srgb.icc,...), I think
that it is not the same thing about "preview"... (see further notes
about sRGB output).

Some people could be worried, is "RT_SRGB" identical to
"sRGB_Color_Space_Profile" and different from the preview. Moreover,
what are the effects of another gamma?

<File:RT_prev_sRGB.jpg%7CPreview> en SRGB <File:RT_sRGB.jpg%7COutput>
RT_sRGB <File:SRGB_color_space.jpg%7COutput> sRGB_Color_space_Profile
<File:RT_sRGB_gBT709.jpg%7COutput> sRGB gamma BT709
<File:RT_sRGBg23p8.jpg%7COutput> sRGB gamma=2.3 slope=8

#### How to use it ?

To satisfy a desire for simplicity, the Output profile will be a
derivative of the Working profile, the box Output profile appear in
grey. That means Output profile = Working profile.

For instance, you select Working profile = Prophoto and Free gamma = 2.1
and slope =4.0.

Then you validate a TIF output or towards the editor and you generate an
output TIF file, with Prophoto profile and gamma 2.1 / 4.0. To open the
file in an external editor (e.g. Photoshop CS), it will appear "Prefer
the embedded profile: sRGB IEC61966-2.1 (RTH gamma BT709 similar to HP
sRGB)" that match to the RT_sRGB_gBT709 profile but with a modification
that we will examine further.

Other example, you select Working profile = sRGB and Free gamma=2.3 and
slope=10.0, you are going to generate a TIFF with sRGB and gamma 2.3 and
slope=10 output. To open the file in an external editor (e.g. Photoshop
CS), it will appear "Prefer the embedded profile: sRGB IEC61966-2.1 (RTH
gamma BT709 similar to HP sRGB)" that match to the RT_sRGB_gBT709
profile but with a modification that we will examine further.

If you enable the option (Photoshop CS): "Delete the embedded profile",
the TIFF file will appear with the new RGB values due to the new gamma
and slope values, but the image look will be different (file headers
missing).

The algorithm uses the LCMS function "CMSToneCurve":

- the output spaces are computed from their primary (red, green, blue),
  e.g. for Prophoto : p1=0.7347; p2=0.2653; p3=0.1596; p4=0.8404;
  p5=0.0366; p6=0.0001;
- the gamma parameters are computed with the "calcgamma" function that
  will, accordingly with the gamma and the slope, determine 5 parameters
  to give to the LCMS2 right function.

So, we create a pseudo-profile, kind of RGB "Prophoto" and with a gamma
matching the selected one.

But we find here, a LCMS2 gap, which creating this profile, does not
write the matching profile in the file header, because it works with RGB
values and not with LUT / Lab. Theoretically, it should need as much
profiles with an adapted gamma and not only one. In practice, I brought
a large modification to Output Gamma and worked around the LCMS2 gap, by
applying - after the RGB conversion, a profile \*.icc that has the same
features that the \*.icc or \*.icm profiles used by Output Gamma but
where the rTRC, gTRC, bTRC tags are computed with "calcgamma".

To improve the understanding of the TIF processing in linear mode, you
can read the Dcraw tutorial from Guillermo Luijk
<http://www.guillermoluijk.com/tutorial/dcraw/index_en.htm>

From which the necessity to have in the "Iccdirectory" folder, the
"\*.icc" and "\*.icm" files: BestRGB.icm ; BetaRGB.icc; Bruce.icm;
WideGamutRGB.icc, (and thus the icc/icm files added for the
pseudo-Prophoto , Adobe, SRGB in "Iccprofile/output").

#### RawTherapee profiles quality

The user can ask himself with reason what is the RawTherapee profiles
validity (RT_sRGB, RT_Large,...)?

These profiles have the same features that the "original" ones
(AdobeRGB1998, Prophoto, SrGB Color Space Profile), there is only small
differences at the primaries and/or white point level. They do not have
any incidence on output quality and level.

In the other hand, TRC have more detailed LUT going from 1024 points to
4096 points. This has for consequence - in the sRGB case that is the
more frequent output - a histogram with much less fish bones that may
bring posterization in the shades. Here is for comparison with the same
image, a 16 bits histogram enlargement in low lights, between sRGB Color
Space profile and RT_sRGB
